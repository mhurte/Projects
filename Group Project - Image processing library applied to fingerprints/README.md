# Introduction
This repository concerns the modelling project about Finger prints from January 2023. The group is composed of Maelig HURTE, Karlotta KILIAS, Yiqun LIU,Julien REMY and Maxime RENARD (order not representative).

## Organization of the files
In the file *data* you will find both the original images that were provided as well as the ones we generated and included for some of them in our report. The file *complexity_graphs* contains some graph where the complexity of the DFT methods has been plotted. You will also find them in the report. Last but not least, the *include* file contains the headers of our files and *src* the *cpp* versions.

## Special case
The source file *general_main.cpp* enables you to have a quick overview of our work, but not all methods have been presented in it as it would have been too long. Thus, travelling across sources files is also recommended.
